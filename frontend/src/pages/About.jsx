          EduSense turns everyday study habits into a clear, honest reflection. The aim is simple:
          give students a mirror for their routine early enough to do something with it, and to do
          it in a way that respects both their privacy and their sense of self.

        <Card>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-ink-600">
            The models are trained on four separate student datasets totalling well over thirty
            thousand records. Rather than reporting a single flattering number, the score model is
            trained on one source and then measured on an untouched holdout, with a second dataset
            kept as a negative control where transfer is expected to fail. That cross-dataset check
            is deliberately conservative: it tells us how much of the pattern is real and how much is
            an artefact of one particular survey.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-ink-600">
            The behavioural inputs you provide are mapped into the model feature space using
            documented, midpoint approximations. This is why the score is presented as an indicative
            direction rather than an exact figure. Being open about that boundary matters more than
            claiming a precision the data cannot support.

                It works from self-reported habits, which are honest but imperfect. The output is
                only ever as good as the reflection that goes in.

                It does not diagnose any medical or psychological condition, and it cannot predict an
                individual&apos;s marks. It describes patterns, not fate.

                It is one input among many. A mentor, a counsellor, or your own judgement should
